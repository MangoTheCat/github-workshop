> * No +1 comments or *Thank you!* comments.
> * Do not submit large pull requests without asking first.
> * Comply with the repo standards. Really, do what the owner says.
> * Don't be upset if
>     - your issue is not answered
>     - your PR is ignored
>     - you are told to change your PR
>     - your PR is rejected
> * Friendly reminder comments are OK (private emails not!)

# RSS/Atom feeds for commits

# Gists

* Public vs secret

# GitHub API

> * Manipulating GitHub progratically
> * From R: https://github.com/gaborcsardi/gh
> * Get a GitHub token
> * Set GITHUB_PAT environment variable

# Not just code

> * git & GitHub are great for R Markdown
> * Data analysis, presentations, etc.
> * Scientific articles (not in word)
> * Anything that is text, really: see e.g. Awesome R

# Pain points

> * If something goes wrong, it will be hard to fix it.
>   Just don't tinker with the history. If you do, always
>   make backups first.
> * No code review tools with R support
> * No multi-platform continuous integration support
> * R package GitHub repo is also for distribution:
>   auto-generated files are in the repository,
>   diffs are bloated.
> * Price

# Additional material

* Software carpentry
* GitHub help pages
* Hadley Wickham's R packages book
