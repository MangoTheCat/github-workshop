# Printing

You can export your presentation to PDF by sending it to print in list mode in Chrome and Opera desktop browsers.

1. Press `Cmd P` or `Ctrl P`
2. Select PDF in targets list
3. Save resulted file

## Limitations

All built-in themes’ features are tested in PDF format, the only limitation is multiple columns: Chrome and Opera don’t support them on print yet.

Always check print results, sometimes they could be different from how it looks in browser. It’s better to test resulted file, not preview picture, in some cases it looks worse than file.

## Other options

You could also try [Prince](http://princexml.com), [wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf) and such console utilities for printing, although not complete modern CSS features support and complicated configuration make them less convenient.
