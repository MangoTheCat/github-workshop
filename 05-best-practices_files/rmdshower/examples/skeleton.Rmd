within the document.

# Slide with Plain Text

Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his
identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the
droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can
go about his business. You can go about your business.

Move along. Move along. Move along.

What is it? Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi
Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a
more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were
the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark
times, before the Empire. How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth
Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire
hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.

How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made
to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My
joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you
going?

# Lists

1. Simple lists are marked with bullets
1. Ordered lists begin with a number
1. You can even nest lists one inside another
    * Or mix their types
    * But do not go too far
    * Otherwise audience will be bored
1. Look, seven rows exactly!

# Formulas

Formulas are rendered by KaTeX, https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX

It supports both inline: \(y = x / 2\) and displayed formulas:

\[ x_{1,2} = \frac{- b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

# Slide with quote

> The bad news is that when ever you learn a new skill your going to
> suck. It's going to be frustrating. The good news is that is typical and
> happens to everyone and it is only temporary. You can't go from knowing
> nothing to becoming an expert without going through a period of great
> frustration and great suckiness.
