# What is version control?

> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of
> files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

**Pro git, by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub**

<!-- * Ask, “Who uses ‘undo’ in their editor?”
  All say “Me”. ‘Undo’ is the simplest form of version control. -->

# Why version control?

> * Records all changes.
> * Easy to go back, and *undo*.
> * Multiple version of the project, fast switching.
> * Easy and disposable experimentation.
> * Automatic merge.
> * Conflicts are detected.
> * See what has changed: diffs.
