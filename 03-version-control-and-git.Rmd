# What is version control?

* Ask, “Who uses ‘undo’ in their editor?”
  All say “Me”. ‘Undo’ is the simplest form of version control.

# Why version control? PhD comics figure

# The basics of how git works: the DAG

# Clone the repo of an R package on GitHub, gaborcsardi/praise

# Open it in R Studio

# Look at history

# Change something, look at the git status

# git add, look at the git status again

# git commit, look at the status, look at the history
